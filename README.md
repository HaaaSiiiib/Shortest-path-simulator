## INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THE PATH SIMULATORS

- Press **"M"** to generate a random maze
- **First click** sets **Start Point** or *Shibgonj* [Let's call it S for short ðŸ™ƒ] (in Orange); **Second click** sets the **End Point** in this case *Tilagor* [T for short] (in Blue)
- Further clicking will generate **barriers** in Black
- In the weigted path algorithms i.e. Djikstra and A*, click on an unoccupied cell (White) while keeping the **"W"** key pressed to increase the weight of that cell by 1.
- To **deselect** i.e. to make it into an unoccupied cell (White) use **ctrl+click** or **right click**.
- After you are done selecting 'S' and 'T', you may press to **"spacebar"** to start the visualization of the path finding algorithm.
- Press **"R"** to reset the whole grid i.e turn all cells white
- Press **"C"** if you just want to clear the path that was created in an earlier execution. ( *THIS DOESN'T AFFECT THE BARRIERS, WEIGHTS, AND START/END POINTS* )



## About the two weigted path algorithms Djikstra and A* : 

There are great similarities in the two algorithms, with the difference being that
A* has a heuristic mechanism while Dijkstra does not. With the heuristic, A* 
usually outperforms Dijkstra in speed in finding a path, however, unlike Dijkstra,
the path A* finds may not always be the optimal one.


Here are some examples of simulating the shortest path with help of respective algorithm.
